            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>RESOLVES FOR Good Government; <hi>And a</hi> Crown <hi>for</hi> England, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a</hi> Cross.</head>
            <p>A Tyrants Test, and a good Magistrates Pourtraiture, are worthy our contemplation in these froward times; in the one, we may read what our condition had been through God's most righteous severity: had he not graciously interposed in the other what our condition is, and may expect to be through his meer mercy so interposing. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny makes Earth a Hell, and a Tyrant is a Devil incarnate. Just Government, is a Crown to the People, instead of a Cross, and makes Heaven on Earth. Bad Government, is Hell broke loose, where all would rule, and none be ruled; every mans lust would be every mans law; his wants measured by his will, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts by his desires, which would render men Furies in flesh, and daily Tormenters to themselves and others; and therefore a Parliamentary Government, the onely Remedy, for the Peoples Malady: For note, <hi>Usurpers Tyranny is a Complication of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; whereby Men</hi> (being Gods in power) <hi>become Devils in practise to terrifie &amp; torture all that withstand them in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Actions.</hi> The tender mercies of Tyrants are cruel; for he is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58094:3"/> a Devil in heart, though a Man in shape; a Lyon in power, and a Bear in practise: From which <hi>Good Lord deliver Us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may we not conclude, that the good Hand of Providence, and the Christian Care, indefatigable pains, and unwearied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, of the never to be forgotten Members of the famous long Parliament, hath opened the mouthes of Many Saints of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehensions, agreeing together as one man, with one Heart and Lip, in prayers and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But as God is pleased to divert and lay low the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Haughty, so he raises and lifts up the Hearts of the Lowly: as the lower the Ebbe, the higher the Tide; so his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation shall not exceed his Exaltation, he looks not so much upon his fine Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uine of many Thousands, who desired nothing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58094:3"/> more then a true settlement of the publique peace, upon a firm Basis, and irremovable Foundation, of Truth and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to preserve a good Conscience, in casting off these ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Reproaches, of breach of Faith to their Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>And thereupon divers Honourable Members of Parliament, being spirited to stand firm for the Interest of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, (being warranted in their present actings, by especial Commission and Authority from the Council of State) unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously declared their Resolutions and Concurrence, to hazard <hi>All,</hi> even Lives and Fortunes, for restoring of the Parliament and People to their ancient Rights, and undoubted Freedoms: In pursuance whereof, it pleased God to raise up Deliverers, both by Sea and Land, having by admirable providence put an opportunity into the hands of General <hi>Monck,</hi> a most able and experienced Commander of the Parliaments Army; Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Lawson,</hi> Commander in chief of the Fleet under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Conduct; and Colonel <hi>Whetham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> whose Actions and Undertakings have been so Hone-and Honourable, as that they have given an absolute Check to the Exorbitances of such who have betray'd their Trust, &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contrary to the Light of Knowledge, in these late and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Dispensations, and so to become Instruments of some mens ambitions, by making the good people of <hi>England</hi> their Enemies, and exposing the Nation again to the hazard of a new War and intestine Troubles.</p>
            <p>But blessed be God, these Clouds are extinguishing, and the black Vizards of these dark and obscure Tyrannical Streams, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to run and center in their proper Current: For, not onely Colonel <hi>Riches</hi> Regiment of Horse have deserted the Army, and returned to their former duty of obedience to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also some of Colonel <hi>Berry</hi>'s Regiment of Horse, in all Nine Troops; and several Companies of Companies of Colonel <hi>Lago</hi>'s Regiment of Foot are gone into <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> marching with Drums beating, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58094:4"/> of the Parliament, and the security, service, and peace of this Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Upon the coming in of the said Nine Troops, and five Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot, Sir <hi>Arthur Hasilrigg,</hi> Colonel <hi>Morley,</hi> Col. <hi>Walton,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Whetham</hi> (the Governour) sent out a party of Horse and Foot to make a discovery of the remainder part of the Army; and having good intelligence amongst them, and of their motion, upon their approach near, it pleased God the whole party came in, some few Officers onely excepted; so that the Siege was raised, and the Town at liberty, without a drop of bloud.</p>
            <p>The Town is very strong, and the Souldiery unanimous, Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> and Col. <hi>Morley</hi> having behaved themselves very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the carrying on of this great Work so happily begun, and for a timely deliverance of these almost destroyed Nations, it is the Duty of every English man to assist, that Posterity may be happy under a Succession of Parliamentary Authority, derived from a Civil, rather than a Military Foundation, from whence floweth nothing but unlimited and arbitrary streams. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto, a Letter hath been sent from Sir <hi>Arthur Hasil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigg,</hi> and the rest of the Parliaments Commissioners at <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <hi>London</hi> desiring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their aid and assistance, for restoring of the Parliament, and setling the ancient Rights, Charters, Liberties, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental priviledges of these N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hereupon, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, assembled at Guild-Hall, <hi>London,</hi> on <hi>Thursday</hi> the Two and Twentieth of this instant <hi>December;</hi> where, after reading of the said Letters, a Committee of Safety was chose, who are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to consider thereof, and to return an answer unto Vice-admiral <hi>Lawson:</hi> as also unto that which came from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at <hi>Portsmouth.</hi>

            <p>The said Committee is also appointed to consider of setling the Militia of the City, to the end, that the peace and safety ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be inviolably preserved, and the Exorbitancies of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever (for the future) prevented.
